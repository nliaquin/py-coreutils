# py-coreutils
These are rewrites of Unix/GNU programs in Python. I'm looking to replace the following coreutils: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/core_utilities

## Installation
There is an installation bash script which requires you to be a sudoer.
chmod +x install.sh and ./install.sh to install and use my python coreutils
chmod +x uninstall.sh and ./uninstall to remove and go back to GNU coreutils
